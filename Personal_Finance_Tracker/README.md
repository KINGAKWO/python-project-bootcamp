# üí∞ Personal Finance Tracker

A simple, Python-based personal finance tracker that helps users record and monitor their income and expenses locally.
Built as part of my Python Developer journey ‚Äî Phase II (freeCodeCamp x Microsoft x IBM learning journey).

## üìã Features

- **Add Transactions**: Easily add income or expense entries with descriptions, amounts, and dates.
- **View Transactions**: Display all transactions in a formatted table, sorted by date, with running totals.
- **Financial Summary**: Get an overview of total income, expenses, net balance, and average expenses.
- **Search & Filter**: Search by keyword, filter by date range or type (income/expense).
- **Monthly Summary**: Analyze income, expenses, savings rate, and top categories for a specific month.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate bar charts comparing monthly income vs. expenses using Matplotlib.
- **Export Options**: Export data to CSV or JSON for external analysis.
- **Persistent Storage**: Saves data to a JSON file for continuity across sessions.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid inputs, file errors, and corrupted data.

Total Expense:                        0.00xaf
Net Balance:                      1500.00xaf
```

### Visualization
Option 6 generates a bar chart (saved as `finance_chart.png`) showing monthly income vs. expenses.

## üß† Tech & Concepts Used

- **Python Fundamentals**: Loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures (lists, dicts).
- **File Handling**: JSON I/O for data persistence.
- **Error Handling**: `try/except` for validation and robustness.
- **Libraries**: `matplotlib` for visualization, `csv` and `json` for exports.
- **Date Management**: `datetime` for parsing and validation.
- **Modular Design**: Clean, readable code with functions for each feature.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Build a Flask web dashboard for financial insights and interactive charts.
- Add user authentication for secure, multi-user data access.
- Implement advanced data visualization (e.g., pie charts for expense categories).
- Integrate with APIs for automatic transaction imports (e.g., bank statements).
- Add budgeting features and alerts for overspending.

## üì∏ Screenshots

- **Visualization Chart**: A bar chart comparing monthly income (green) and expenses (red), saved as `finance_chart.png` after running the visualize option.
