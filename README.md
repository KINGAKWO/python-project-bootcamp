# 🐍 Python Project Bootcamp — From Challenges to Real-World Applications

Welcome to my **Python Project Bootcamp Portfolio** — a collection of real-world projects that showcase my growth as a developer.

After completing the **Microsoft Python Development Career Certificate** and over **50+ FreeCodeCamp daily coding challenges**, I transitioned into this **project-based phase** to apply Python to automation, data analysis, web development, and AI.

Each project here is designed to:
- Strengthen core Python fundamentals through **real-world applications**
- Demonstrate clean, modular, and maintainable code
- Build confidence for **technical interviews** and **portfolio reviews**
